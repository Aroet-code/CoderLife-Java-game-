what things do i need to draw?
----CAFE----
1. Exterior of the cafe     DONE!!!
- door
- walls
- fences
- places where people eat
-- umbrellas
-- tables
-- chairs
- decorations
-- flowers
- label
2. Interior of the cafe
- tables
- chairs (sofas)
- bookshelf
- foods display
-- don't draw the food just yet
- floor
-- floor itself
-- carpets
- walls
-- a door behind a counter
-- a toilet door (I plan on making one of the player's dates call him out on not washing his hands before starting to eat)
Just so you know, I will probably need to draw a first perspective look on the cafe as well, just for a date. Like, a view should include, a window, the date, the table, a part of the cafe. There should also be some noise that people usually hear in cafes. (Check out Everlasting summer's dining room sfx)
3. Toilet room
description:
A small room with a sink on the right and one cabin in the middle. Tiled floor. (Cyan/dark cyan) and (white/gray) color theme. 
- A cabin
-- Opens/closes
-- Toilet inside
- A sink
-- Streams water (with an sfx)/doesn't
- A mirror
-- Just make it black, i will add the reflection myself
